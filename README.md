# GAN_Flowers
Train a simple GAN on flowers dataset.

## Dataset 
The flowers dataset includes 3670 labeled images (5 classes of flowers).
The images are in different sizes.
Here is a sample of images:

## How to train your model?
To train a model that generates flowers from the input noise, you need to define 2 main models: 
1) Discriminator, 2) Generator.<br />

The overall structure of a GAN is shown below:
